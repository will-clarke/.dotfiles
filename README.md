# ðŸ–¥ My Dotfiles ðŸ–¥

The aim is these should work both on MacOS & Linux.

I try to keep my tools simple. At the moment I like Doom emacs, the fish shell & tmux.
On MacOS, I use Karabiner for some better shortcuts / customisability.
On Linux I like Arch & Sway as a window manager.

## ðŸ›  Installation ðŸ› 

Grab a copy of [GNU Stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)
One of these should work:

- `sudo apt install git stow`
- `sudo pacman -S git stow`
- `brew install stow`

Then

1. `git clone` this repo
2. `git submodule init` to grab all the other stuff
3. install doom emacs
4. `stow tmux` and anything else you may want

## ðŸš¨ Git Submodule Alert! ðŸš¨

There are some submodules attached which may live in private repos.
You may not have access to everything here.

## Different Binaries

Since MacOS and Linux are slightly different, I've got two sets of executables.

## âš¡ TL;DR âš¡

```
cd $HOME
git clone git@git.sr.ht:~will-clarke/.dotfiles --recursive
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
stow bin-{mac,linux} config emacs git org pass tmux stories wclarke.net
```

You may need to reinstall `fisher` packages to get `fish` working properly.

```
cp  ~/.dotfiles/config/.config/fish/fish_plugins plugins-tmp
fish -c 'fisher remove < plugins-tmp'
fish -c 'fisher install < plugins-tmp'
# May help..... $ fish -c 'fisher install IlanCosman/tide@v5'
```

# This may help if installing Ubuntu

```sh
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:fish-shell/release-3
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

openssh-server
tailscale
tmux
htop
bat
ripgrep
postgresql
postgresql-contrib
git
fd-find
curl
fish
stow
pass
pass-extension-otp

# if dealing with Ubuntu and dodgy wifi firmware
linux-headers-$(uname -r)
broadcom-sta-*
```
